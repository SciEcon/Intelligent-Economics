# Introduction 

Gradescope can help the instructor to properly administer and grade all of the assessments, no matter online or in-class, and it is designed to save time grading and get a clear picture of how the students are doing. This platform supports all subjects to be graded, including Computer Science, Economics, Mathematics, Engineering, etc. It creates a platform for the instructor to make a profile of all the assignments that have been designed, including exams, homework, and codes. At the same time, it supports a quick and flexible grading experience by applying detailed feedback with a simple click. Moreover, Gradescope also supports visualization of the rubric level and overall statistics to better understand the students’ progress. This platform also explores the potential AI-assisted grading experience by applying Natural Language Processing techniques to classify the students’ assignments and thus enable the instructor to grade by group. Overall, this platform optimizes the grading experiences and makes the hands-on experience more efficient.

# How Gradescope: a step-by-step guide

By enabling Gradescope as a tool in Sakai, the instructor and students can directly have the access to Gradescope website for assignment submission and grading. For the instructor, through syncing the Sakai course site to the corresponding Gradescope course, rosters and future grade posting will be automatically implemented from Gradescope to Sakai. After the sync is done, instructors can start to set up Gradescope assignments according to their demands, such as problem sets, quizzes, code assignments, or other customized homework formats created by beta version, where it also allows individual or group submission. After the deadline, the instructor can start to grade students’ submissions based on imported or designed rubrics, and it can be synced directly with the corresponding assignment in Sakai, thus students can check their grades either from Sakai or Gradescope. Every submission will be evaluated on an individual basis properly, with clear comments and grades based on rubrics. It is also convenient for students to check their grades and feedback directly from Gradescope.

# Pros and Cons

Summary:
Gradescope is generally a user-friendly integrated platform for assignment submission and grading. We have figured out several pros and cons in our use as both students and TAs. We highly appreciate the integrated functionality of Gradescope but think some details need more attention. 
Pros:
1. **The integrated functionalities**: Gradescope allows instructors/TAs to 
(1) upload assignments and attachments;
(2) set up sub-questions and specific answer positions with the beta version;
(3) upload grading rubrics and add additional comments, and (4) review and export grades, and students to upload their assignments with tags for every question.

2. **Free access and connection with Sakai**: Gradescope is connected with Sakai, which provides free access for instructors, TAs, and students.

3. **User-friendly operations**: The web pages of Gradescope are clear and instructive. Users can easily customize the assignments and grading procedure.

Cons:
1. **Rubrics uploading**: The grading rubrics can only be uploaded after at least one submission of the assignment. And the rubrics cannot be replicated from another assignment.
2. **Auto-grading tools**: There are no auto-grading tools to grade the assignments.
3. **Complex assignment grading**: Complex assignment grading can only be done by setting sub-questions. And there are no logic settings within the sub-questions.
