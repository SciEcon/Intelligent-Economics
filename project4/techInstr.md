## About

For writing in emerging fields and interdisciplinary disciplines, writing skills are no longer the only need. The new era of research requires an increasing number of writing techniques to be mastered. This article introduces some of the software and platforms that are needed for writing, typesetting as well as content creating, and provides some relevant references.

## Languages

### Latex

It is highly recommended to use Latex when you’re intended to type professional-looking mathematical expressions, algorithms with pseudo-code, and tables. You can take a screenshot and copy-paste the output to your text editor.

[QuickStart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VhmkLrOjLsw) Watch this YouTube video to get a quick overview of Latex.
[Overleaf Latex Guideline](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tutorials) Here you can find a comprehensive Latex tutorial provided by Overleaf. You should be able to find any other Latex format guidelines here if not provided below.

- Language Basic
  - [Structure](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Creating_a_document_in_LaTeX) Latex document structure guideline.
  - [Symbols](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/List_of_Greek_letters_and_math_symbols) Reference for frequently used symbols in mathematical expressions.
  - [Fonts](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_fonts) Use different fonts in mathematical expressions.
- Latex Application Scenarios
  - [Images](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Inserting_Images) Insert images in Latex.
  - [Expressions](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Mathematical_expressions) Type mathematical expressions in Latex.
  - [Tables](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Tables) Create tables in Latex. To create professional-looking Latex tables, package booktabs is recommended [booktabs tutorial](https://jdhao.github.io/2019/08/27/latex_table_with_booktabs/).
  - [Algorithms](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Algorithms) Generate pseudo-code in Latex. Check *[algorithmicx package](https://mirrors.bfsu.edu.cn/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/algorithmicx.pdf)* documentation for more information. See [Algorithm Template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/examples/pseudocode-example/pbssqzhvktkj) for a template.
  - [Bibliography](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_with_bibtex) *biblatex* supports auto-generated in-text citation and bibliography entries in various styles. You can first use reference management software mybib to collect bibliography information; then you’re able to directly download the whole bibliography file, and then load it into your project and cite them. Here is the sample of the [mybib project folder](https://www.mybib.com/j/RambunctiousSavoryMole) and [overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/3919267845jggwnhsftqkf) where we included an instruction for citation in Latex.
  - [Author/Affiliation/Thanks] Use *[authblk package](https://mirrors.hit.edu.cn/CTAN/macros/latex/contrib/preprint/authblk.pdf)* to add author/affiliation information to the beginning of your article.
- How to troubleshoot
  - When you encounter a problem that is difficult to solve, consulting the official documentation is always the ultimate solution. The official documentation will not only give many code examples, but also solutions to some common compatibility issues.
  - Here are a few additional websites that provide easy access to search solutions:
    - [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/)
    - [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
    - [Bytes](https://bytes.com/)
